# Personal NOTES:
Sunday - 08/06/23

I'm a dumbdumb, I was using authcontext to pass the token around instead of using basic reading comprehension. The API docs states to pull the token from either registration or login! Duh! I need to slow down and think more. I was looking at past projects on github. I thought about placing the ajax helpers in api/index.js. I'll continue building out the components with the ajax helpers inside, then go back and fix this. I may forget using authProvider, instead I'll pass the token.
